# 🐍 BeginnerPY - First Python Scripts by Huczz

⚙️ A collection of small Python projects made during my very first days learning to code (Day 1 to Day X).  
These scripts are basic, fun, sometimes messy — but they’re mine 😎

> 🎓 Started learning Python: July 2025  
> 🤖 No AI help, just Google, videos, and a lot of coffee.

## 📦 What's inside ?

| Script Name        | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `discordgen.py`    | Generates fake Discord gift links (learning loops, random, and time) |
| `2players_game.py` | A 2-player guessing game with turns and win/lose logic |
| More coming...     | As I learn more, I drop them here |

## 📝 Notes

- The code uses a mix of **French and English**.  
  But all **important elements** (variables, functions, outputs) are in **English** for readability.
- Some code may seem overcomplicated on purpose — that's me testing stuff 💡
